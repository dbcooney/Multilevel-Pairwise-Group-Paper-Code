# Multilevel-Pairwise-Group-Paper-Code

This repository accompanies the preprint "Steady-State and Dynamical Behavior of a PDE Model of Multilevel Selection with Pairwise Group-Level Competition", by Konstantinos Alexiou and Daniel B. Cooney. It will include all of the scripts used to generate the figures in the paper. It includes all of the scripts used to compute numerical finite volume simulations of the dimorphic and trimorphic multilevel selection models and to generate all of the figures in the paper.

The repository is organized into three folders: Scripts, Figures, and Simulation Outputs. All of the scripts can be run using Python 3.10.

For reference, below is a list of figures and the scripts that were used to generate each figure.
